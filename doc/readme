PyGEP is a simple library suitable for academic study of GEP (Gene Expression 
Programming) in Python 2.5, aiming for ease of use and rapid implementation. It 
provides standard multigenic chromosomes; a population class using elitism and 
fitness scaling for selection; mutation, crossover and transposition operators; 
and some standard GEP functions and linkers.

PyGEP is intended for research, not commercial application. Those interested in 
a full GEP system are advised to visit Gepsoft, makers of GeneXproTools.
